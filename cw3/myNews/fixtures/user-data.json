\"great day for science and humanity\". \r\n\r\nTheir vaccine has been tested on 43,500 people in six countries and no safety concerns have been raised. \r\n\r\nThe companies plan to apply for emergency approval to use the vaccine by the end of the month. \r\n\r\nStock markets soar on Pfizer Covid vaccine news \r\n\r\nA vaccine - alongside better treatments - is seen as the best way of getting out of the restrictions that have been imposed on all our lives. \r\n\r\nThere are around a dozen in the final stages of testing - known as a phase 3 trial - but this is the first to show any results. \r\n\r\nIt uses a completely experimental approach - that involves injecting part of the virus's genetic code - in order to train the immune system. \r\n\r\nPrevious trials have shown the vaccine trains the body to make both antibodies - and another part of the immune system called T-cells to fight the coronavirus. \r\n\r\nTwo doses, three weeks apart, are needed. The trials - in US, Germany, Brazil, Argentina, South Africa and Turkey - show 90% protection is achieved seven days after the second dose. \r\n\r\nPfizer believes it will be able to supply 50 million doses by the end of this year, and around 1.3 billion by the end of 2021. \r\n\r\nThe UK should get 10 million doses by the end of the year, with a further 30 million doses already ordered. \r\n\r\nHowever there are logistical challenges, as the vaccine has to be kept in ultra-cold storage at below minus 80C.", "date": "2020-11-09", "category": 1, "article_pictures": "Covid01_CrB9Zkq.png", "liked": []}}, {"model": "myNews.article", "pk": 2, "fields": {"title": "Covid: Wales has lessons for England on surviving", "author": "Michael Buchanan", "content": "When Covid struck, no-one quite understood how ruinous its ripples would be.

The introduction of football is a consequence of British influence.\r\n\r\nThe game arrived full of World War One prestige. It moved down the social scale and was re-interpreted by the locals, transformed into a more balletic sport ideal for the player with a low centre of gravity - very true of the squat, little Maradona.\r\n\r\nAnd the reinterpretation led to international triumphs and recognition for a part of the world starved of such attention.\r\n\r\nNobody embodied this story better than Maradona.
